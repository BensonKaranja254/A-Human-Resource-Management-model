# HR Analysis and Employee Turnover Prediction

 This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates my expertise in data analysis and machine learning through a logistic regression model designed to predict employee turnover. Using a comprehensive HR dataset, I explored factors influencing employee retention, such as satisfaction level, work hours, and salary.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas to uncover insights into employee turnover patterns, identifying key trends among employees who left versus those who stayed.
- **Machine Learning**: Built and trained a logistic regression model with scikit-learn, achieving a 77.3% accuracy score in predicting employee turnover.
- **Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations, including a heatmap of the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Leveraged Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and joblib for model persistence.

This project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using robust data science techniques. Explore the notebook to see the full workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and feel free to reach out for questions or collaboration opportunities!
